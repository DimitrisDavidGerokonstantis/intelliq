# Software Engineering Project 2022-2023 (IntelliQ)
   
This is our semester project for the Software Engineering course of National Technical University of Athens. Its goal  
was to create a functional application that enables the user to answer 'smart questionnaires', meaning questionnaires  
where each answer given by the user leads to a different question. This project is called IntelliQ.    

##  Features   
Our application offers the user an extensive UI (frontend) where he/she can choose a questionnaire, answer it and also  
check details about a specific questionnaire. We have also developed an interactive user interface for the admin of the  
system, where he/she can create new questionnaires (or uplaod them directly in a JSON format), and perform other    
administrative actions (healthcheck, reset the system, reset answers of a specific questionnaire etc -more details in the  
README file of the frontend). We have also developed a CLI tool, that the administrator can use to perform all of these  
actions, using CLI commands. Our project provides documentation done with Visual Paradigm and Postman and both the API and   
the CLI have been tested.     

##  Programming Languages/Frameworks used   
| Part of the project  | Language/Framework |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Backend/API  | JavaScript(node.js/express.js)  |
| Frontend  | HTML, CSS, Javascript  |   
| Database  | MySQL  |  
| CLI  | JavaScript (node.js)  |    
| Testing  | JavaScript (node.js)  |  
| Documentation  | Visual Paradigm, Postman  |

The more specific dependencies/packages used will be specified in the README files of each particular folder of the project.      
For our collaboration regarding both the code and project management we used GitHub.
